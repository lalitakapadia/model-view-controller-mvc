##Description
This project follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language to deliver HTML pages to a client browser, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It enables users to interact with a server-side relational database (MySQL) through npm express routes to create, update and view blog posts, and submit comments to other blog posts.
